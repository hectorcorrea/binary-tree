This project implements a binary tree class and a class to draw the binary tree in Ruby.

Class BinaryTree implements the binary tree and its basic operations (adding nodes, removing nodes, and walking the tree)

Class BinaryTreeDrawer implements the code to "draw" the binary tree. This class does not draw the tree per-se but rather calculates the coordinates where each node should be drawn and calls a specified block to do the actual drawing.


CAN I SEE THIS CODE IN ACTION?
------------------------------
I am glad you asked! Point your browser to http://binarytree.heroku.com to see this code in action.


STARTING WITH THE SOURCE CODE
-----------------------------
* Take a look at the code samples under the samples folder. They include basic examples on how to create a binary tree, add/remove nodes, perform searches, and how to use the drawer class.

* lib\binarytree.rb has the binary tree implementation.

* lib\binarytreedrawer.rb has the code to draw the tree.

* The unit tests under tests are also another good place to start.


A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE
----------------------------
The web site at http://binarytree.heroku.com is a more comprehensive sample of usage. This site used HTML 5's canvas element to actually draw the binary tree on a web page.

The code for this web site is also on this git repository. Run web_server.rb to get it running on your local environment. You'll need Sinatra to run this web site on your box, though. 


COMMENTS, THOUGHTS, SUGGESTIONS?
--------------------------------
This is my first Ruby program so very likely it does not follow Ruby's best practices or the Ruby way of doing things but it's a start. 

Feel free to comment and/or reach me if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.
